# Advanced_Web_Assignements

## Assignement 1

### Instructions
First, create a GitHub account, if you don't have one already. Next, create a repository for this assignment. In that repository, start a new Node.js project, with a package.json file.  Install express JS with the following command:

npm install express --save (You will notice that a new directory is created called node_modules).

Create a .gitignore file and include the entire node_modules directory. 

### README.md

Create a README.md file using markdown. Use the cheatsheet provided to describe the app you will be creating for your project. It should contain at least 3 markdown syntax elements. The README.md file should provide the name of your project and a short description of what your website will do. 

### package.json
Your package.json file should define one "script".  It should simply run an "index.js" file that writes out any information when the script is called.

### index.js
This file contains the information to be displayed and can be called using the package.json information listed above.

Although it's not an assignment requirement, ideally this function should have something to do with the site you plan to build in this class.  For example, if you plan to build a movie site, you could create a function that takes a number of stars as an argument, and returns a string describing how good the movie was ... and then logs that string.
